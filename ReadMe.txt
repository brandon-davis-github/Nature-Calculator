The code will pull data from a .csv file to match with your input.

Once the input is matched with the .csv file, the code will run
through a series of "if" calculations within the NatureCalculations class.

After the calculations are complete, the program will return to the user
a value or values of Natures as a string that are optimal based on the 
Pokemon's stats.
